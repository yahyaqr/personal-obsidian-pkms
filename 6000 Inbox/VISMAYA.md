There is no one-size-fits-all financial calculation for a design agency, as the financial performance of a design agency will depend on a wide range of factors, including the size and scope of the agency, the types of clients and projects it works on, and the geographic location in which it operates.

In general, a design agency will need to generate enough revenue to cover its expenses, including salaries and wages for employees, rent and utilities for its office space, marketing and advertising costs, and any other expenses related to running the business. The agency will also need to generate a profit, which is the difference between its revenue and its expenses.

To calculate its profit, a design agency will need to track its revenue and expenses on a regular basis, and compare them to determine how much profit the agency is generating. This can be done by using a variety of financial tools and techniques, such as budgeting and forecasting, financial modeling, and cost-benefit analysis.

In addition to calculating its overall profit, a design agency may also need to calculate the profitability of individual projects or clients. This can be done by tracking the revenue and expenses associated with each project or client, and comparing them to determine the project's or client's contribution to the agency's overall profit.

Overall, the financial calculation for a design agency will involve tracking and analyzing a wide range of financial data, and using this data to make informed decisions about how to operate the business and generate profit.

When preparing a business proposal for a design agency, there are a number of financial measurements that may be needed in order to demonstrate the feasibility and potential profitability of the business. Some examples of financial measurements that may be needed for a design agency business proposal include:

1.  Total start-up costs: This measurement represents the total amount of money that will be needed to get the design agency up and running, including costs for office space, equipment, marketing and advertising, and any other expenses that will be incurred before the agency begins generating revenue.
    
2.  Projected revenue: This measurement represents the total amount of money that the design agency expects to generate from its clients and projects over a specific period of time, such as a year or a quarter. This can be calculated by estimating the number of projects and clients that the agency expects to work with, and the average revenue that will be generated from each project or client.
    
3.  Projected expenses: This measurement represents the total amount of money that the design agency expects to spend on operating expenses over a specific period of time, such as a year or a quarter. This can include costs for salaries and wages, rent and utilities, marketing and advertising, and any other expenses that will be incurred in order to run the business.
    
4.  Projected profit: This measurement represents the total amount of money that the design agency expects to generate as profit over a specific period of time, such as a year or a quarter. This can be calculated by subtracting the agency's projected expenses from its projected revenue.
    
5.  Break-even point: This measurement represents the point at which the design agency's revenue is equal to its expenses, and the agency is no longer generating a loss. This can be calculated by dividing the agency's total start-up costs by its projected profit margin (which is the percentage of revenue that the agency expects to generate as profit).
    

These are just a few examples of the financial measurements that may be needed for a design agency business proposal. The specific measurements that are needed will depend on the unique characteristics of the agency, as well as the goals and objectives of the proposal.
