It is not possible for me to provide a complete syllabus for a social media content creation internship at Vismaya without knowing more about the company's goals, target audience, and existing knowledge and skills of the interns. However, I can offer some potential topics that could be included in such a syllabus.

Here are some possible topics for a social media content creation internship at Vismaya:

-   Introduction to social media and its role in business
-   Understanding Vismaya's target audience and their behavior on social media
-   Developing a social media strategy and content plan
-   Creating engaging and shareable content (text, images, videos, etc.)
-   Using design tools and techniques to create visual content
-   Writing effective copy and headlines for social media
-   Collaborating with other teams and stakeholders on content creation
-   Analyzing and tracking the performance of social media content
-   Managing and responding to customer comments and feedback
-   Best practices and trends in social media content creation

These topics could be covered through a combination of lectures, discussions, workshops, case studies, and hands-on activities. The specific format and duration of the internship will depend on the needs and goals of Vismaya and the intern.
