If they do complement your experience and a list of (soft and hard) skills…definitely, why not?

These online certifications and competitions alone, like I said, cannot guarantee job placements.

Other intangibles beyond a candidate’s credentials are considered: relevant work experience, communication, ability to work independently, creative problem solving, and so on.

List these competitions and certificates on your resume as a portion of your [formal education](https://www.visualcv.com/blog/how-to-write-a-resume-in-2019/?utm_campaign=alberto_quora&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=quora "www.visualcv.com"), and a recruiter might ask for proof of course completion.

That said, a certificate from one of these online institutions won’t carry nearly as much weight as the experience and expertise you can offer to a company.

Focus more on [building a portfolio](https://www.visualcv.com/blog/how-to-write-a-resume-in-2019/?utm_campaign=alberto_quora&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=quora "www.visualcv.com") of relevant work experience and mix & match skills to increase the value you bring to the table.

"Worth" is a notion that is relative to what you value, which Quora users don't know. Here are some skills that participating in TopCoder may help you improve:

-   Coding small programs quickly.
-   Reasoning formally and mathematically about problems.
-   Pattern matching problems to algorithms.
-   Writing small pieces of tricky code that don't contain many bugs, or that are correct the first time around.
-   Looking at small pieces of other people's code and detecting both subtle and non-subtle bugs quickly.  
    
-   Clearing job interviews.

If you're expecting it to be a silver bullet in your software development career, it's not. If you're expecting it will make you an amazing software engineer all by itself, it won't. It'll improve the skills I mentioned above, which will make you a better software engineer when combined with many other important skills you'll have to acquire elsewhere. This may be valuable to you...or not, depending on what you value.
