Today's Log
---
- [ ] Day 5: On day 2 of my #100DaysOfCode, I enrolled in the AWS Backend Developer Scholarship Program, which consists of Cloud Practitioner Essentials, JavaScript for Beginners, and Backend Development for Beginners. Today is my first day doing the lessons. http://aws.dicoding.com
- [ ] End of Day 5: The Cloud Practitioner Essentials lesson is theoretical and takes longer than expected. I want to quit midway, but my dedication pushes me to progress by at least 50%. Nevertheless, I am happy to learn about various AWS services. I got a lot of AHA moments.
