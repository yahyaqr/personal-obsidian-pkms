Today's Log - Day 3
---
- [ ] Day 4: I guess not every day you get to achieve your goals. I had been busy with my non-coding activities. I haven't finished Next.js Docs (my goal on Day 2) and LinkedIn Learning's React lesson (my goal on Day 3. The 24-hour free lesson has expired). #100DaysOfCode
- [ ] End of Day 4: I completed a free LinkedIn Learning lesson, “React: Building Styles with CSS Modules” I learned about CSS Modules (composes, styles-module, media-module) and enhanced my understanding of stateful and stateless components through hours of debugging.😛 #100DaysOfCode
