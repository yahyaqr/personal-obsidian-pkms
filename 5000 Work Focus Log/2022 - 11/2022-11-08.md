Today's Log
---
- [ ] I enrolled in Dicoding Backend Developer Scholarship, http://aws.dicoding.com. As a result, I had access to Cloud Practitioner Essentials and Beginner Back End courses for 90 days. I could extend the scholarship if I am able to complete the courses within 90 days.
- [ ] I also enrolled in Zuri Internship, an African-based youth tech-upskilling program, [http://training.zuri.team](https://t.co/VdwG1u8Nxu). It requires at least 25 hours weekly on program content and adding to 7 weeks in total. I was told that I will join for the next cohort.
- [ ] Day 2: Today's learning goals are to complete the Next.js Docs, earning a certificate on Free LinkedIn Learning 24-Hours for React [http://linkedin.com/learning/react-js-building-an-interface-8551484…](https://t.co/G0ZQM6MHaS), and continuing my React Native Lessons on Codecademy.
