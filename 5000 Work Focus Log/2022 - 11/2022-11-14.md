Today's Log
---
- [ ] Day 8: Starting the day with progressing Beginner JavaScript on [http://aws.dicoding.com](https://t.co/JLRxMdYuCi). Then I stumbled upon Advanced Scrum on LinkedIn Learning. I often saw it on job offer requirements, so I decided to learn about it. #100DaysOfCode 
- [ ] I am planning to complete [http://aws.dicoding.com](https://t.co/JLRxMdYuCi) and [http://codecademy.com](https://t.co/e4cNFGRSCU) in the next four days. Upon that completion, I will earn nine certificates. It will give me ease of mind as I finally be able to shift my focus from earning credentials to portfolio building. #100DaysOfCode
