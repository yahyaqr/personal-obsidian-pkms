# Lean and Agile Principles


> Produce quality products 100 percent of the time.

## Lean principles
- Empower the team
- Visualize work
- Embrace the scientific method
	- Continuously learn and improve
	- Embrace change
- Improve the "flow" of value
	- Limit work in progress / small batch size
	- Map the value stream
	- Pull work
	- Eliminate waste
	- Reduce setup times
	- Automate what should be automated
- Build quality in
	- The process should identify problems
	- Fix problem when they are discovered
	- Identify and fix the root cause

## Agile Manifesto
- Empower the team
	- "Individuals and interactions over processes and tools"
- Embrace change
	- "Responding to change over following a plan"
- Partner with the customer
	- "Customer collaboration over contract negotiation"
- Plan, develop and deliver incrementally
	- "Working software over comprehensive documentation"

## Principles and Ideas from the Lean & Agile Manifesto
- Empower the team
	- "Individuals and interactions over processes and tools"
		- Select motivated individuals
		- Teams should self-organize
		- Collaborate to create shared understanding
- Embrace change
	- "Responding to change over following a plan"
		- Partner with the customer
		- Obtain fast feedback
		- Continuously inspect and adapt
- Plan, develop and deliver incrementally
	- "Working software over comprehensive documentation"
		- Prefer conversations for conveying information
		- Continuously refactor to maintain agility
		- Maintain a sustainable pace
		- Completed work items are the primary measure of progress
		- Plan, develop and deliver incrementally
- Focus on value
	- "No quote"
		- Eliminate waste
		- Continuously strive for simplicity
		- Don't compromise on quality

## Lean vs Agile
- Lean
	- Used at MIT by John Krafcik (1988)
	- Described the ideas of the Toyota Production System
	- Applies to any type of project
- Agile
	- Used by the participants who created the Agile Manifesto (2001)
	- Described a lightweight alternative to waterfall software development
	- Applies to any type of project
- The terms are often used interchangeably
- Can think of lean as more "foundational" than agile - you can be lean and use waterfall project management

# Scrum Overview
## Takeaways
- Scrum is an agile framework
- An increment is a potentially shippable portion of the project that meets the "definition of done"
- A sprint is a time-boxed period in which an increment is created
- Scrum artifacts provide transparency, enable shared understanding, and enable inspection and adaptation
- Artifacts include the product backlog, the sprint backlog, the sprint goal, the sprint boards, and the scrum reports.

## Scrum Artifacts
- Product backlog
- Sprint backlog
	- Estimation - Story points
- Sprint goal
- Sprint board
- Scrum Reports
	- Burndown chart
	- Velocity chart

## Scrum Roles
- Product Owner
	- "Product value"
	- "Interacts with, represents, and is accountable to stakeholders"
	- Communicating the product vision
	- Maximizing the value of each increment
	- The product backlog
- Scrum Master
	- "Team effectivenes"
	- Promoting and supporting scrum
	- Improving the day-to-day effectiveness of the team
	- Protecting the focus of the team
	- Increasing the transparency of the project
	- Typical tasks
		- Coaching
		- Facilitating
		- Monitoring
- Development Team
	- Cross-functional, adaptive team that does the work of the project
	- Responsibilities
		- Estimating issues
		- Deciding how much work can be done in a sprint
		- Deciding how to organize to do the work of the sprint
		- Creating the increment of each sprint
		- Ability to modify the sprint backlog during the sprint
	- Recommended: 3-9 members per scrum team
- Stakeholders
	- Internal
	- External

## Characteristics of all scrum meetings
- FIxed maximum time limit
- Meetings are primarily to plan, inspect, and adapt
- Primarily about collaborating, not updating status
- Primarily spend time on things of value to all participants

## Sprint Planning
- Attendee
	- Scrum team
- Duration
	- 4 hours
- Purpose
	- Plan the work of the sprint
- Output
	- Sprint goal
	- Sprint backlog

## Daily Standup
- Attendee
	- Development team and scrum master
- Duration
	- 15 minutes
- Purpose
	- Inspect recent progress toward the sprint goal
	- Plan the day's work
	- Identify any impediments, and plans to resolve them
- Output
	- Plan for the day

## Sprint Review
- Attendee
	- Scrum team and stakeholders
- Duration
	- Typically 2 hours for a 2 week sprint
- Purpose
	- Inspect rthe increment and collaboratively update the product backlog
- Output
	- First-pass next sprint backlog

## Sprint Retrospective
- Attendee
	- Scrum team
- Duration
	- Typically 90 minutes for a 2 week sprint
- Purpose
	- The team inspect itself, including its processes, tools, and team interaction
- Output
	- Improvement issue(s) added to the next sprint's backlog

Kanban = Continuous Issue
Scrum = Time constraint
