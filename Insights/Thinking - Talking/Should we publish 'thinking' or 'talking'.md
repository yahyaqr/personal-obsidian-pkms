##### Depends on what personal brand that you want others to perceive from you.

-   Andy Matuschak (Former Research Head at Khan Academy) publishes his 'notes' as sort of work in progress/best thinking so far on topics he's researching and thinking about.
	-   He wants to be known as being at the leading edge of current thinking and practice in his field.
	-   *Thinking in progress.*
-   Malcolm Gladwell (Journalist and Best Selling non-Fiction Author) publishes his very refined, entertaining, and easy to follow opinions.
	-   He wants to be known as an opinion-maker who shapes the thinking of others. 
	-   *Refined thinking.*

1. If your audience is looking to you for what we might traditionally think of as “expertise” then the Gladwell approach is the better one.
2. Alternatively, if your audience is perhaps more sophisticated/advanced in your subject matter, and if they will think for themselves (whatever you say), then Matuschak approach is better for you to expose your “work in progress” as food for thought, inspiration, provocation etc.
