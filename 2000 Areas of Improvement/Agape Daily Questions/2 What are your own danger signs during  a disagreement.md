### Error:
1. **Grammar:** The personal pronoun “I” should be uppercase.
2. **Possible agreement error:** Did you mean “am” or “will be”? (I googled and chose went)
3. **Punctuation:** Use a comma before ‘and’ if it connects two independent clauses (unless they are closely connected and short).
4. **Grammar:** The personal pronoun “I” should be uppercase.
5. **Grammar:** The personal pronoun “I” should be uppercase.
6. **Grammar:** It seems that “sometimes” fits better in this context. Please check.
7. **Grammar:** The personal pronoun “I” should be uppercase.
