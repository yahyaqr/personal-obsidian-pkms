JSX Conditionals: &&

We’re going to cover one final way of writing conditionals in React: the `&&` operator.

Like the ternary operator, `&&` is not React-specific, but it shows up in React surprisingly often.

In the last two lessons, you wrote statements that would sometimes render a kitty and other times render a doggy. `&&` would _not_ have been the best choice for those lessons.

`&&` works best in conditionals that will sometimes do an action, but other times do _nothing at all_.

Here’s an example:

```JSX
const tasty = (
	<ul>
		<li>Applesauce</li>
		{
			!baby && <li>Pizza</li>
		}
		{
			age > 15 && <li>Brussels Sprouts</li>
		}
		{
			age > 20 && <li>Oysters</li>
		}
		{
			age > 25 && <li>Grappa</li>
		}
	</ul>
);
```

If the expression on the left of the `&&` evaluates as true, then the JSX on the right of the `&&` will be rendered. If the first expression is false, however, then the JSX to the right of the `&&` will be ignored and not rendered.

```JSX
// judgmental will be true half the time.
const judgmental = Math.random() < 0.5;

const favoriteFoods = (
  <div>
    <h1>My Favorite Foods</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Sushi Burrito</li>
      <li>Rhubarb Pie</li>
      {!judgmental && <li>Nacho Cheez Straight Out The Jar</li>}
      <li>Broiled Grapefruit</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
);

ReactDOM.render(
	favoriteFoods, 
	document.getElementById('app')
);
```
