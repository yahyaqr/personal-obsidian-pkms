Components Interacting Recap

In this unit, you learned how to use `import` and `export` to access one file from another. You learned about `props` and `state`, and the countless variations on how they work.

Before this unit, you learned about JSX, components, and how they can work together.

A React app is basically just a lot of components, setting `state` and passing `props` to one another. Now that you have a real understanding of how to use `props` and `state`, you have by far the most important tools that you need!

In future lessons, the focus will shift slightly outward. In addition to learning more new skills, you’ll also learn your first _programming patterns._ These large-scale strategies will help you combine what you’ve learned and really start building.
