State

[Dynamic information](http://www.teach-ict.com/as_a2_ict_new/ocr/AS_G061/311_data_info_knowledge/static_dynamic_data/miniweb/pg4.htm) is information that can change.

React components will often need _dynamic information_ in order to render. For example, imagine a component that displays the score of a basketball game. The score of the game might change over time, meaning that the score is _dynamic_. Our component will have to know the score, a piece of dynamic information, in order to render in a useful way.

There are two ways for a component to get dynamic information: `props` and `state`. Besides `props` and `state`, every value used in a component should always stay exactly the same.

You just spent a long lesson learning about `props`. Now it’s time to learn about `state`. `props` and `state` are all that you need to set up an ecosystem of interacting React components.
