**What is a LEAD?**

In copywriting a LEAD is the first bit of copy your reader will read after the headline. This is where you begin to lead the reader on the path you want to take down the line.

The objective of the first sentence of the first paragraph (the Lead) is to get you into the second one, and then the third… and so on. You get the point. So, **the first paragraph has to be great!** 

Here are the characteristics of a LEAD:

-   **Solid**
-   **Relevant**
-   **Enticing**

Efficiency is key. Make your lead relevant and interesting, otherwise, people won’t read. Write short sentences. Make it intuitive and fun. Why? Because if you lose your reader in your first sentence, you lose everything.

**How to create a great lead like a pro – here are a few options you can choose from:** 

1. Place your reader into the story.  
2. Describe a problem your reader can relate to.  
3. Set a stage.  
4. Make a bold statement.  
5. Ask a question.  
6. Show that you understand your reader – write your lead with empathy.  
7. Highlight a controversial bit of data.  
8. Tell a story or a personal anecdote.  
9. Use an analogy.

**A great lead has the ability to surprise you, and get you intrigued.**  **A great lead inspires**. It can be the best part of your story. In fact, according to studies, **a solid lead can increase conversion rates by 200%**. Now, that’s motivating enough to create the best lead out there for your story, isn’t it?

**The trick is to start with simple, easy-to-read, interesting, and curiosity-building sentences that will grab your reader’s attention**. Once you have their attention, it will be easier to make them read on. And, here’s a tip: a really effective approach is to lead with a question you’ve actually heard asked by one or more of your target audience.
