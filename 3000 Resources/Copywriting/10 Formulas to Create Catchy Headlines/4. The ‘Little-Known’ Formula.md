This formula generally refers to ‘little-known methods’ that people would want to know about. Just like the ‘secret’ formula, it makes people interested and curious to find out about methods only a few people actually know about.

You create a feeling of being at an advantage when learning information other people don’t know about yet.

Here’s how to plant the seed of curiosity:

-   Little known methods to become a social media expert
-   3 Little known methods to give up unhealthy eating
-   Little known secrets of Stuart Little (to develop healthy habits)

As you can see, you can also mix numbers with these formulas for even better results.
