It is a known fact that people like reading lists â€“ mostly because they are easy to read and scan.

When having a list in mind, make sure it revolves around a word at superlative, such as the best, or the greatest of all times, etc. Obviously, it has to be implemented in your headline. Not the list. The {number+word} at {superlative+something} would obviously imply that a list is on the way, down the line.

The way to use this formula is like this:

-   10 Most inspiring places to see in Europe
-   The top 5 famous marketers we need to learn from
-   The 20 funniest videos to see in 2018

Lists work like magic, especially when they contain relevant, helpful information people can actually relate to and are able to use in a practical way.
