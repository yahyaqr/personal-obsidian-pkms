If you’re a cinephile, you’ll recognize all of the above quotes. They’re memorable lines from movies that have cemented their place in the film-going public’s consciousness. 

Movies like the above are memorable—and oftentimes, meaningful—not because of their ability to entertain, although that’s a given. But rather, because of their capacity to move audiences, regardless of age, through the medium of storytelling.

A good marketer can learn a thing or two from Hollywood. 

Take, men’s shaving brand, [Harry’s](https://www.harrys.com/), for example.

At one time, everyone knew razor blades were too expensive and overdesigned. Yet few if any companies had the courage to acknowledge it and take the market leaders head-on…

Until Harry’s came along. 

Not only did they arrive in the marketplace and agree with what everyone was saying, but they lobbied for better, more ergonomic razors at affordable prices.  

Like a biblical fable, it was a story that buyers could get behind: Harry’s David to Gillette’s Goliath, fighting for the everyman. And despite growing to unanticipated heights in recent years, Harry’s has continued to remain true to their status of “welcomed prophet.”

Storytelling is important when considering positioning, but it’s equally important when writing good [product descriptions](https://sleeknote.com/blog/product-descriptions). 

[ThinkGeek](http://www.thinkgeek.com/), a retailer that caters to “geek culture,” often combines storytelling with pop culture references in their product descriptions to engage potential buyers.

Writing product descriptions like the above requires a LOT of time. And it’s not recommended if you’re selling commodities. But if you’re not, and what you’re offering is unique, it might be worth trying for your best selling products.
