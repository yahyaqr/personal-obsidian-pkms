Read enough ads written by copywriter Joe Sugarman and you’ll notice something interesting.

Often, near the end of his ads, Sugarman would write something to the effect of, “If you aren’t absolutely satisfied, return your product within 30 days for a prompt and _courteous_ refund.” (Italics mine.)

At first glance, it reads like a normal [satisfaction guarantee](https://sleeknote.com/blog/satisfaction-guarantees). And if you thought that, you would be right in doing so. But in reality, he was doing more than that… 

_He was engaging the buyer’s emotions._

Here’s how Sugarman describes the strategy in his book, _The Adweek Copywriting Handbook_,

> The emotion or the feel of that phrase really says that we are a very respectful and understanding company that will return your money very promptly. With very few words, I conveyed the feeling of being a concerned company that acts promptly … even though the phrase makes no logical sense.  

The takeaway, then, is when writing copy, it’s important to remember to **sell on emotion,** but **justify with logic.**

And as we’ll explore throughout the remainder of the article, many of the strategies are built on that fundamental premise.
