I’ve already talked about one of Cialdini’s “weapons of influence,” authority. Now, I want to share another familiar favorite, but with a twist.

Every marketing blog under the sun has written about the importance of social proof. And we’re no exception. In fact, we’ve written about it before ([here](https://sleeknote.com/blog/social-proof) and [here](https://sleeknote.com/blog/customer-testimonials)).

So, to avoid repeating myself, I want to show you one brand is using an updated version of it in the digital age.

[Fabletics](https://www.fabletics.com/) is an online retailer that offers “Affordable, high quality and stylish workout clothes for women.”

However, rather than sharing customer reviews on their [product pages](https://sleeknote.com/blog/product-page-examples)—like their competitors are doing—they repurpose their customer’s Instagram posts on their homepage.

Not only that, but they continually add more social proof by inviting new customers to submit images of their own:

Embedding customers’ tweets and Instagram posts is a great way to add legitimacy to a product’s value, and for time-strapped e-tailers, it’s never been easier to take advantage of.

### **Note from Rikke**

Another reason social media social proof works well is due to potential buyers getting to see what the product looks like on “real” people. This is especially true if you’re in the apparel market. 

By showcasing images of previous customers wearing your products, it reassures for potential buyers that the product looks as good on “real” people as it does on supermodels.
