A powerful, yet often-overlooked copywriting principle is writing like you talk.

But if you _really_ want to connect with readers, you need to write like _they_ talk.

And it makes sense: If you’re not joining the conversation already occurring in the buyer’s mind, how are they expected to relate to and buy from you?  

One brand that illustrates the art of writing for a specific audience is [Barkbox](https://www.barkbox.com/).

Much like the above ThinkGeek example, Barkbox uses phrases like “Barkbox is like the joy of a million belly scratches,” and “When your dog falls in ruv with something from the box” to connect with potential buyers.

And judging from their growth, year over year, it works like a treat. (Sorry, I couldn’t resist.)

One of my favorite ways of getting inside a buyer’s mind is browsing Reddit. 

First, go to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/).

Then, in the search field, type in a relevant keyword (e.g. “bodybuilding”).

Next, choose a relevant subreddit. There’s a lot to choose from, but in this example, I’ll choose r/gainit as it’s quite active (258k members).

Then, look at the phrases Redditors use in their posts. In the example below, the author uses phrases like “hypertrophy” and “progression” to explain how he gained 31 pounds.

Using phrases that your ideal buyers use will build familiarity, and with any luck, increase the chances that they’ll buy from you.
