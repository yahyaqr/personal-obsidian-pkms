If you’ve read Robert Cialdini’s highly-influential book, _Influence_, you know that authority is one of six “weapons of influence.” 

Leveraging it correctly, though, varies depending on the marketplace you’re in and the marketing channel you’re using. 

If you’re in the health and fitness industry, for instance—a marketplace rife with charlatans—you might be wondering, “How can I show expertise when my buyer has been taken advantage of countless times before?”

One way, if you’re a brand like [Ritual](https://ritual.com/), is to combine multiple sources of authority. On their product pages, Ritual introduce the doctors they consulted with during the creation of their products.

And if that’s not enough, they also include the badges of major media outlets that have covered them like _The New York Times_ and _Health_.

Granted, you won’t always have or need to rely on people with letters after their name, but in industries with incredulous buyers, it might help.
