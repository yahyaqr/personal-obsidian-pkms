[Power words](https://sleeknote.com/blog/power-words), according to copywriter [Jon Marrow](https://smartblogger.com/power-words/), are “persuasive, emotional words that trigger a positive or negative response.”

He continues,

> They can make us feel scared, encouraged, aroused, angry, greedy, safe, or curious. Authors, copywriters, and content marketers use “power words” to spice up their content and compel audiences to take action.  

My favorite [power words](https://sleeknote.com/blog/power-words) to use when nudging a reader to take action are _“best,”_ _“new,”_ and _“now.”_

And I’m not the only one.

Look at the below email my colleague, Seray, got recently:

![Pandora Email Example](https://www.drip.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/Pandora-Email-Example.png?width=715&height=545&name=Pandora-Email-Example.png)

[Pandora](https://us.pandora.net/) knows that people want the _newest_ and _best_ of everything, regardless of price. And they want it _now_.

So if you’ve got a new product, and you know that it’s the best on the market, tell your buyers—and give them a reason to get it immediately.
