“A trigger,” writes Joe Sugarman in his book, _Triggers_, “is a tool for influencing, motivating and persuading a prospect to make a purchase.” 

There are 30 triggers, in total, and while each deserves an article of their own, there’s one trigger I want to focus on in particular: _exclusivity_. 

“To be the owner of something that few others can own is one of the strong human motivations,” writes Sugarman. The goal, he explains, is to make the buyer feel _special_. And there’s no better way to do that than offering products with limited availability.

One of my favorite brands that use the exclusivity trigger in their marketing is [MeUndies](https://www.meundies.com/).

A large portion of their revenue comes from their membership subscription. But where they differentiate themselves from their competitors is by offering monthly designer prints.

The best part is, while they’re exclusive, they’re also limited, meaning once they’re gone, they’re gone. And it’s something die-hard fans can’t resist getting their hands on.
