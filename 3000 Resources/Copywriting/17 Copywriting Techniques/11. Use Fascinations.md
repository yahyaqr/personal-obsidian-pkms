Mel Martin is the greatest copywriter you’ve never heard of.

Unlike his contemporaries that relied on and overused “how to” bullets in their ads, Martin quickly made a name for himself due to his distinctive bullet writing style.

One bullet, or fascination as it would become known, was “What Never to Eat on an Airplane.”

Buyers couldn’t help but make a purchase to learn more. And Martin made Boardroom, the company he worked for, millions of dollars in revenue.

Going beyond feature/benefit bullet points, fascinations go one step further and open an information gap, urging readers to buy to satisfy their curiosity.

Here’s a great example from [Digital Marketer](https://www.digitalmarketer.com/). Notice how each fascination subtly draws you in, enticing you to learn more.

Writing good fascinations is one of the hardest copywriting skills to master. But if you begin adding them to your marketing materials, particularly your sales pages, your revenue will skyrocket.
