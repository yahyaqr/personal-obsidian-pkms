I wrote earlier about “the Life Force 8,” from the book _Cashvertising_. Specifically, the biological desire of wanting to be superior, winning or keeping up with the Joneses.

Another biological desire I want to mention here is the need for _freedom from fear, pain, and danger._

“Your goal is not to create new fears,” writes Whitman, “but to tap into existing fears, either those on the forefront of consumers’ minds or those that require a little digging to uncover.”

One fear that plagues endless people—particularly those who have experienced it or know of others that have—is the fear of being a victim of a crime.

The home security industry knows this better than anyone. And it’s exactly why brands like [Protect America](https://www.protectamerica.com/) reference it in their copy

“Selling the scare,” as Whitman calls it isn’t for every business. And chances are it might not be for yours. But if it is, and you’re not taking advantage of it already, it might be worth playing on the fears that loom at the forefront of your buyers’ minds.
