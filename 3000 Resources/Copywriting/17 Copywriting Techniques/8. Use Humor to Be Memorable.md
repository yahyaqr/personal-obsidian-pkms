So far, we learned that telling stories is persuasive. And making readers feel emotions—especially positive emotions—and linking those emotions to your offer, is equally important.

But what about [humor](https://sleeknote.com/blog/funny-email-examples)? Does making a reader laugh increase the chances that they’ll buy from you?

Not always. But you _are_ more likely to stay top of mind, longer, and with little chance of getting knocked off by a competitor. And in today’s crowded marketplace, that’s better than nothing.

[In one study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13421-013-0335-4), subjects were able to recall nouns found in bizarre sentences such as “The dog rode the bicycle down the street” rather the nouns from the common counterpart “The dog chased the bicycle down the street.”

So, if you’re in a noisy marketplace, making prospects laugh might be the fastest way to their wallets.

[Poo-Pourri](https://www.poopourri.com/) is my favorite example of a brand using [humor in their marketing](https://sleeknote.com/blog/funny-email-examples).

From their about page to their email campaigns, Poo-Pourri uses a unique blend of humor and salesmanship to get people talking about their products.

And with coverage in outlets like Adweek, it’s easy to see that, while juvenile at times, they’re doing something right.
