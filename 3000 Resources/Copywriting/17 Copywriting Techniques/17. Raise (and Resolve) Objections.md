No matter what you’re selling or who you’re selling to… 

Not everyone will buy from you.

That’s a given. And it’s a reality you can’t change, despite what marketers will have you believe. But for those who _will_ buy from you, there are certain objections—pricing, shipping, etc.—that prevent them from moving forward and making a purchase.  

I’ve written about objection handling before in the form of using [_reverse testimonials_](https://sleeknote.com/blog/customer-testimonials)—having a customer address an objection they had, in their testimonial, and overcoming it for you. That’s one way to do it.

An easier approach, though, is raising and resolving concerns on a frequently asked questions (FAQ) page. 

I recently found a great example from [Orabrush](https://www.orabrush.com/), who addresses a common objection to buying their product:

Avoid mistaking an [FAQ page](https://sleeknote.com/blog/how-to-build-an-faq-page) as a nicety; it’s a necessity when it comes to raising and resolving buyer objections. And it’s one you can’t afford to not have.
