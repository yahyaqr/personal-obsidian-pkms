You experience reality through your five senses—taste, sight, touch, smell, and sound. 

It doesn’t matter whether you’re reliving a favorite memory—like walking on a beach—or imaging a future desire—like eating a hot fudge sundae—our senses render that experience.

It’s no surprise, then, that savvy marketers often try to create images and even movies inside the buyer’s mind to trigger—and heighten—certain senses when selling their goods and services.

One of my favorite examples of creating, “mental movies”, as Drew Eric Whitman calls them, is British chocolate brand [Thorntons](https://www.thorntons.co.uk/).

They know that taste is everything when it comes to chocolate. So they add descriptive adjectives to their copy to cause the reader to salivate at the thought of savoring their chocolate. 

Bottom line?

Telling stories, as we’ve already learned, engages readers. Telling emotional stories engages readers on a deeper level. Telling emotional stories that trigger a sensory response? An absolute gamechanger.
