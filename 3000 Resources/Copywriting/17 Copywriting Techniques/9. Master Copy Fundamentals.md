With the average attention span of only [12 seconds](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2016/03/12/humans-have-shorter-attention-span-than-goldfish-thanks-to-smart/), it’s more important than ever that your copy jumps off the page and grabs the reader by the throat. (Dramatic, I know, but I had to get your attention, right?)

While the words you choose play a big role in holding a reader’s attention, so, too, does the way you _accessorize_ those words. 

What I mean here, specifically, is adding **bolding for emphasis** and **paragraphs for readability.**

Take the following product descriptions, for example. Which are you more likely to read? 

A wall of copy:

Or, a carefully-copyedited product description with bolding and paragraphs like this example from [Firebox](https://www.firebox.com/)?

The answer is obvious, isn’t it?

Adding bolding and paragraphs to your copy won’t make a big difference to orders overnight, especially if you’re starting out. But it will boost a reader’s on-page dwell time. And that’s one advantage more than you had before.
