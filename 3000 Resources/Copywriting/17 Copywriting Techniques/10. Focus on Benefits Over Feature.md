Writing a benefit for each product feature might sound like common knowledge…

…but that doesn’t mean it’s common practice.

A refresher: 

A feature describes what a product is; a suitcase with a built-in front nylon pocket. A benefit, by contrast, describes what a product gives you; quick-access to essentials like boarding passes.

(A value, if you want to go one step further, if what the _benefit_ gives you; a feeling of superiority, etc.)

While it’s easy to assume features and benefits are reserved only for technical products, they also work great for simpler, high-end products.

Take mattresses, for example.

Few people know the difference between memory foam or spring mattress. And those that do, can’t always explain why one out-benefits the other.

That’s why brands like [Herman Miller](https://store.hermanmiller.com/home) ensure that each feature (“visco-plastic memory foam”) has a benefit (“keeps you isolated from vibrations and movement”) and a value (“allows for natural rest”) to remove friction from a potential buyer’s decision making.

A good rule of thumb I learned from copywriter Andy Maslen is, for every line of copy that you think is a benefit, ask yourself, “Is the reader likely to say, ‘so what?’ after reading it?” If so, it’s not a benefit and needs improvement.
