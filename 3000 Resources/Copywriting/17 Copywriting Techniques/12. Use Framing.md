Did you know that you react to information differently depending on how it’s presented to you?

[In one study](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/211/4481/453), subjects were more likely to choose a medical program if it was framed positively.

That might sound obvious, but it’s a lot more deceptive than you think, especially when it’s unexpected—like on a pricing page. 

Take [Blue Apron](https://www.blueapron.com/), for instance.

![Blue Apron Price Per Serving](https://www.drip.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/Blue-Apron-Price-Per-Serving-1024x490.png?width=1024&height=490&name=Blue-Apron-Price-Per-Serving-1024x490.png)

Rather than frame their offer as serving per monthly, like their competitors, Blue Apron frame it as serving per daily to help potential buyers relate to the cost more easily. 

And it makes sense: few people think of meals in terms of their monthly cost. But if you’re like most people and you’re thinking of ordering food in, then cost is top of mind, front and center, every time.

Consider how you’re framing key information like pricing. Oftentimes, it’s enough to nudge potential buyers and impact on-page conversions.
