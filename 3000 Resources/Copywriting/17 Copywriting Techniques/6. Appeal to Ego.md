In the above-mentioned book, _Cashvertising_, Drew Eric Whitman outlines eight biological desires we all have.

One of the eight desires, “Being superior, winning, keeping up with the Joneses,” involves positioning your products and services for buyers who want the best of everything.

Whitman writes,

> Appealing to people’s vanity and ego is most successful when it hones in on characteristics that society considers being desirable, such as physical attractiveness, intelligence, economic success, and sexual prowess.  

That might mean inviting buyers to differentiate themselves from others as [Happy Socks](https://www.happysocks.com/eu/) do in their [email marketing](https://sleeknote.com/blog/best-email-marketing-examples).

Or, like leather-goods maker, [Bellroy](https://bellroy.com/), naming a product that appeals to a certain market segment (e.g. affluent business professionals):

We all have an ego and your buyers are no exception. Do with that information what you may.
