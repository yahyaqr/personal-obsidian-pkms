If you want your copy to convert like crazy, you have to be absolutely obsessed with benefits.

Here’s the hard truth about copy: Trying to outsmart your audience just doesn’t work. They’ve seen it all before.

On that same note, it’s harder than ever before to actually get anyone to listen to you.

Every day, every single one of your readers is flooded with advertisements of all sorts.

The average American adult sees [300 ads per day!](https://www.slideshare.net/dbellerive/stop-touching-it)

![stop touching it branding for business 10 638.jpgcb1388949455](https://neilpatel.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/stop-touching-it-branding-for-business-10-638.jpgcb1388949455.jpg)

And copy is really just another form of advertising.

So why should anyone pay attention to your copy if it’s just another ad?

The answer: _Benefits_.

Today’s consumer is looking for a solution. [If your copy can provide that solution](https://www.joomlashack.com/blog/joomla-how-to/1096-write-copy-that-sells-focus-on-benefits/#!/ccomment-comment=3216), you’ll earn your audience’s attention.

And while your copy needs to touch on several areas of customer concerns, it especially needs to focus on benefits.

Think about it: A solution is one big benefit. And often, a solution encompasses several benefits.

In short, thinking about benefits puts you in the right frame of mind to write awesome copy.

So let’s get down to business and discuss _how_ you can become more benefit-obsessed.

**First, create a value list**. Think about the big solution you offer to your users, and then think about all of the smaller benefits you also offer.

Write all of those down in a list.

The idea is that by writing down every benefit, you’ll be able to [communicate each benefit](http://attitudes4innovation.com/the-benefits-of-advertising-the-benefits/) more clearly.

It sounds simple, but it really does help to see all the benefits listed out right in front of you.

You might have trouble figuring out how to put some benefits into words. That’s good because it means you’re thinking about it before you do any of the actual copywriting.

**Second, know the differences between benefits and features**.

Features are not benefits.

That’s incredibly important, so let me repeat it: _Features are not benefits_.

Features are one-sided. They only describe different aspects of your product or service. Honestly, they can be kind of boring.

You’ve probably seen feature lists like [this one](https://opensnow.com/news/post/feature-list-of-opensnow-pro-superpro) all over the place:

![pasted image 0 1504](https://neilpatel.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pasted-image-0-1504.png)

Sure, this is useful, but it doesn’t give you any reason to invest in the service.

That’s because features don’t focus on the reader at all. In fact, they’re pretty much all about the company and _not_ the customer.

Benefits are much better than features for several reasons.

For one, [benefits help you actually sell](https://projectignite.com/how-to-sell-on-amazon-maintain-profit-margins/) your product.

Benefits sell because they’re literally all about the customer. So is it really any wonder why your readers will be more attracted to benefits than features?

When a customer sees all the benefits you offer, he or she is going to start thinking about those benefits in a personal way.

In other words, your customers will apply the benefits to their own lives and visualize how much better off they’d be with your product.

Benefits also make your product sound more appealing than features can.

Take a look at [this graphic](http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/21/features-vs-benefits):

![pasted image 0 1501](https://neilpatel.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pasted-image-0-1501.png)

Which side do you prefer? If you’re like most people, you picked the right one.

That’s because benefits give readers a specific and detailed idea of what they can accomplish.

In this example, the benefit-driven copy tells you that you can carry 1,000 songs right in your pocket.

That’s easy for anyone to understand, and you instantly understand why you’d want this device.

But the feature-driven copy isn’t as nice. Many people don’t even know how big a gigabyte is, and some people may not use the term MP3 that much anymore.

Features are what your product has or does. Benefits are how your product makes the user _feel,_ [as this image conveys.](http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/02/21/features-vs-benefits)

![features vs benefits umbrella example](https://neilpatel.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/features-vs-benefits-umbrella-example.png)

You should almost always choose benefits over features. Benefits are more detailed, persuasive, and engaging.
