So far in this article, I’ve used the word “you” (or variations like “you’re”) over a hundred times.

“You” is a powerful word.

_It speaks directly to your reader_.

Talk about personalized language.

It’s often considered one of the best power words and for good reason. It breaks down walls and makes an immediate connection with the reader.

Every time you say “we” or “us,” you’re losing out on an opportunity to [make that connection](https://www.slideshare.net/iamcopywritematters/wordsmart-copywriting-tutorial-customer-centric-copywriting).

“We,” “us,” and other similar words are selfish.

The harsh truth is that your readers don’t care about your product. Not really.

They care about how your product will help them live a better life.

That’s why “you” is so powerful. It makes the reader feel special, and it makes the copy sound personal.

At the end of the day, [business is all about the customer](https://www.flashbackdata.com/its-all-about-the-customer/).

Consider this article. It sounds like I’m having a conversation with you, right?

That’s the power of “you.”

Of course, writing super direct and personal copy is easier if you [regularly communicate with your audience](https://neilpatel.com/blog/how-to-strengthen-and-deepen-the-relationship-between-you-and-your-customers/) and get to know them better.
