Most of the people who see your content won’t be ready to convert.

They might be anywhere in the [buyer journey](http://www.b2bknowledgesharing.com/tag/buyer-journey/).

But unless they’re at that final stage, your readers are going to have some objections.

It’s your job to address those objections head-on. You don’t want your readers to have a doubt in their minds about the benefits you offer.

The first step is to determine the specific objections your audience might have.

Sending surveys is a great way to get this information.

I like to use [Qualaroo](https://qualaroo.com/). Their software gives you an easy way to [get insight into customers’ fears](https://blog.qualaroo.com/2013/11/06/cyber-monday-is-coming/).

Once you’ve gained a good amount of feedback, you’re ready to write copy that tackles the main objections people have.

Addressing objections is all about providing solutions to customer problems. You can also think of it as providing answers to questions.

You want to remove as much doubt as possible by being explicit and detailed about the benefits you can offer readers.

[Here’s a great example](https://neilpatel.com/blog/ultimate-guide-to-copywriting/) of copy that covers a bunch of objections in a really compelling way:

This copy leaves no stone unturned. It proves that this service is for all kinds of marketers, no matter how much or how little experience they have.

Every part of your copy, including your headline, should provide your solutions to customer objections.
