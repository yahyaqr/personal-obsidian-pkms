You probably read a lot less online content than you think you do.

What I mean is that you probably don’t _thoroughly_ read much at all. If you’re like [79% of users](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-users-read-on-the-web/), you scan.

That’s no typo. As much as 79% of your readers [aren’t actually reading your content](https://www.advancedwebranking.com/blog/improve-readability/).

![pasted image 0 1505](https://neilpatel.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pasted-image-0-1505.png)

This phenomenon has been documented over and over again with surprising consistency.

In fact, there’s been so much research on this topic that you can predict with accuracy _how_ _your visitors are going to read your content._

The bottom line is that [they don’t read much.](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2013/06/how_people_read_online_why_you_won_t_finish_this_article.html)

So we know that people scan online content, and we know how they scan.

This knowledge has major implications for copywriting. It tells you exactly where to put your focus.

We can learn a few important things from all of this.

**First, put extra effort into your headings and subheadings.**

Readers tend to pay more attention to headings and subheadings more than any other content on the page.

That makes sense. Headings and subheadings stand out the most.

Now I’m going to throw another interesting fact at you: It’s common among scanners to [read only the first sentence of each paragraph](http://www.howtolearn.com/2013/02/skimming-and-scanning-two-important-strategies-for-speeding-up-your-reading/).

With that in mind, you should write content so that _readers can get a complete idea of what you offer just by reading the headings and subheadings_.

Check out [this page](http://securityguards.melbourne/):

Even though there are lots of small paragraphs, you only need to read the subheadings to get an idea of what the services are.

This is ideal for scanners, and it also makes your content more readable overall.

So does all of this mean you should only care about headings? Not at all.

You should still put a ton of effort into everything you write, but put _even more_ effort into [your headings and subheadings](https://neilpatel.com/blog/the-step-by-step-guide-to-writing-powerful-headlines/).

**Second, make the important sentences bold.**

Sometimes, you’ll have a sentence or two that you really want people to remember, and it’s not always fitting to turn a sentence into a heading or subheading.

The solution: Make important sentences bold.

Bold text catches the eye. It almost acts like headings because it can direct the reader’s’ attention.

In [this example](http://www.marketingthatsells.net/blog/saas-website-readability), most readers would look at the image, then the heading, and then the bold text.

**Third, start your headings and main sentences with action words.**

Power words tend to capture people’s attention in a big way.

Sure, most readers don’t actually read. They scan.

But if you can start each sentence or heading with a power word, you might be able to capture their attention.

That’s why you should start your headings and important sentences with [action words](https://brandongaille.com/list-21-great-calltoaction-verbs/) or [power words](https://www.copyblogger.com/scientific-copywriting/).

![pasted image 0 1498](https://neilpatel.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pasted-image-0-1498.png)

These types of words catch people’s attention more, so you’re more likely to keep readers interested if you can hook them in the first place.
