There is a serious lack of story in copywriting nowadays.

No, stories aren’t just for fiction writers. They belong in every piece of copy you create, no matter how big or small.

All throughout human history, stories have been used to create deep connections and make sense of the world.

So it’s really no surprise that they’re so powerful.

Just look at how storytelling [impacts the brain!](https://www.forbes.com/sites/christinecomaford/2016/09/10/have-something-to-say-heres-how-to-ensure-people-hear-you/#45cdae47623d)

Stories can evoke a variety of potent emotions in readers. A good story can change how someone looks at life and even how they view themselves.

[If you leverage the power of story in your copy](https://neilpatel.com/blog/how-to-leverage-storytelling-to-increase-your-conversions/), you’ll be able to create those strong emotional connections and make your offer irresistible.

To understand how to do this, let’s take a look at exactly what makes up a story.

Simply put, a story is a transformation.

All of the best stories involve some sort of radical change in one of the characters.

In this case, your reader is the character. (Ideally, you should have a [buyer persona](https://www.quicksprout.com/2016/04/06/a-step-by-step-guide-to-creating-reader-personas/).)

We’re dealing with a specific type of character here: a _dynamic character_.

[Dynamic characters](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DynamicCharacter) change over the course of the story.

The change happens when the character (your reader) realizes that he or she has an opportunity to have a better life (by choosing you).

See what I’m talking about?

Your reader learns about the change that’s possible only with you.

But don’t worry. You don’t have to be a literature expert or veteran author to create a good story.

In fact, it doesn’t even have to look like a traditional “story” at all.

You can [weave your story into all of your content](https://neilpatel.com/blog/how-to-leverage-storytelling-to-increase-your-conversions/) by using little story snippets here and there. You don’t have to write out every little detail.

Let me show you what I mean.

[Here’s a great use of story](https://onepagelove.com/using-storytelling-to-sell-in-a-landing-page) in a landing page:

![pasted image 0 1503](https://neilpatel.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pasted-image-0-1503.png)

When you read that headline, you realize that there’s a better way to watch movies. That could improve your life by helping you waste less time on bad movies.

It’s not a full story, but it has all the effects of one.

Or how about [this example](https://www.webpagefx.com/blog/web-design/minimalist-landing-pages-deconstruct/):

![pasted image 0 1497](https://neilpatel.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pasted-image-0-1497.png)

Again, when you read the headline, you realize that you can change the way you do email.

The implication with this example is that you could be more efficient with your inbox.

Let me show you [one final example](http://design.davidrozando.com/drew-html-v1.1/):

![pasted image 0 1499](https://neilpatel.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pasted-image-0-1499.png)

This is a cool use of story.

First, you read the headline and get a sense of the benefit you could get with Periscope.

Wouldn’t it be fun to see life from someone else’s perspective?

Then, you see the app, which helps you understand exactly what Periscope has to offer you.

Here, it’s showing a hot air balloon. You may never get a chance to ride in a hot air balloon (or you just might not want to), but with Periscope, you can experience it right on your phone.

Together, these two elements (the headline and the image of the app) create a story.

Like I said, it doesn’t have to be complex.

You just need to _give readers a look into the change that’s possible with you_.
