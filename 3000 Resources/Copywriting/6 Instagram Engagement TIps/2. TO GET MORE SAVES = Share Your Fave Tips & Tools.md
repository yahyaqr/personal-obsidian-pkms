My 3 most SAVED posts of all time all share one thing in common – they are short, educational lists of my top copywriting tools, copywriting courses and copywriting books.

These types of quick _“top 5”_ or _“top 10”_ lists provide insider tips and invaluable shortcuts on a topic that is highly relevant to your followers.

Also, there’s something about lists that we humans just love, am I right? It’s scientifically proven that people are attracted to lists and listicles because they are simple and provide easy frameworks for people to process information quickly in our otherwise oversaturated and overwhelming information age.

On top of a compelling headline and clear list given in the caption that supplements the graphic, we also include clear CTA to comment YES below for us to DM you the links.

Or sometimes we’ll include a _“Save For Later”_ banner directly above the Save ribbon button. One effortless click is all it would take so that there’s no pressure for the follower to make a decision — they can always revisit the post in their folder later.
