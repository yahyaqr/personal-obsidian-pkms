One of the best ways to get your followers to comment is to get them to answer a question, of course! But keep it quick and ask a question that requires very little effort. I like to include the question in the graphic as well because don’t forget **we’re in the scrolling generation!**

You can ask them a multiple choice question, like I did in this post where I asked my followers to let me know where they are at on their copywriting journey.

If you are keeping your question open ended, **make the question painfully easy to answer**. Like in my most commented on post where I simply asked my followers to tell me where in the world they’re from!

It requires very little effort, is easy to answer and evokes a sense of pride and identity!

These types of posts are great to **easily engage your audience** as Instagram’s algorithm tracks and monitors engagement. The higher your engagement, the more likely your posts are to be seen by more people. Again, you don’t want your entire account to be these types of posts, but they are a great way to get conversation going and have a little fun between your heavier content posts.
