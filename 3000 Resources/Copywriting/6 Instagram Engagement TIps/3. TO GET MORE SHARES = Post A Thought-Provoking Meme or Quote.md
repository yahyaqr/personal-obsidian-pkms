Ah, yes the biggest crowd pleasers of all — memes and quotes. Both are punchy, straight to the point, and offer a quick burst of fun. **Just like a tequila shot.**

Memes have the ability to unite us using the universal emotion of humour. There’s no better way to do this than through satire of real life.

And while quotes may have gotten a bad rap lately by those spreading over-simplified, stolen and sometimes painfully cliche wisdom, the numbers don’t lie. People LOVE quotes.

The bottomline is, both memes and quotes **are indisputably powerful and shareworthy**, especially when they are relevant to your audience and speak to their sense of identity or belief-system.

For example, this is my most shared post. It’s a funny quote and speaks directly to our identity writers.

Here’s a meme post that was shared a lot too. Again, it brings us together through humour and a sense of belonging. What people think copywriters do, vs what we actually do.

While memes and quotes are punchy, **you don’t want to overdo it.** One of the best ways you can distinguish yourself from just another random meme account is to mix up your content and when you do share a quote or meme, use the copy in your caption to provide context and even more value to your followers… and don’t forget your call to action!
