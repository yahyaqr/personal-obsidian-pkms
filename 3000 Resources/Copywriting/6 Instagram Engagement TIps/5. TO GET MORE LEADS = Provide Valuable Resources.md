Because Instagram prohibits hyperlinks in their captions, it can be challenging for brands to lead followers directly to their website through regular posts without requiring some serious interest and manual effort from the reader.

Those 3 little words _“link in bio”_ require a surprising amount of effort, which means **you better be giving people a damn good reason to stop their scrolling**, go to your profile and click the link in bio to then leave the app altogether, access your website and take your ultimate desired CTA to sign up or buy something.

With that being said, social media can still be a great source for leads. So see this as a great opportunity to put on your marketing and copywriting hats and ask yourself this question:

What can I give my followers that’s SO good that they’ll stop what they’re doing right now and leave Instagram to get it.

You want to share highly valuable and relevant resources that help them solve one of their most pressing problems.

For example, this is one of my posts that led to the most amount of link clicks.

As you can see, it’s a visual of my Hot Offer Checklist. While the video offers a tangible preview of what you’ll get when you click the link in bio, I didn’t stop there. **The caption brings the heat.** I open with a strong question headline, offer tips on how to get the most out of this free resources and end with a clear CTA.
