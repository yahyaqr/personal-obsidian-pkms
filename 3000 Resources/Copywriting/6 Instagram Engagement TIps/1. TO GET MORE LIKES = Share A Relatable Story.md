My most liked post of all time is this one.

![[Pasted image 20221115221209.png]]

It’s a known fact that actual photos of people do typically get more likes – especially for personality-based businesses like me. So, yes, while this photo of me did help grab attention, I opened the caption **with a strong and relatable question**: _“What if my client doesn’t like my copy?”_

This speaks to one of the biggest insecurities that copywriters have, no matter how long you’ve been doing this! And it’s a question I get a lot.

In fact, this post was inspired by one of my Copy Posse Launch Pad students who was feeling a bit derailed after a client sent back her work with a bunch of edits and comments.

So, I shared our quick exchange with my Instagram community because **it was real, authentic and 100% RELATABLE**. I knew other people would benefit from hearing that even experienced copywriters, like myself and my high-level coaching students, have doubts sometimes and have to deal with less-than-glowing client feedback.

So, rather than trying to pull content out of thin air, as much as you can, share real stories… and be as specific as possible! Remember, **the more specific your story, the more relatable your copy.**

Lastly, don’t be afraid to create polarity, take a strong stand for something you believe in or own up to your imperfections.

Nothing engages people more than a story that **validates their own concerns**, doubts and fears or speaks to a shared cause, mission or belief.
