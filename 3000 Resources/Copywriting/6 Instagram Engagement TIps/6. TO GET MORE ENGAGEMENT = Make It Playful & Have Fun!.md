The best posts of them all are the ones that get likes, comments, shares AND saves. These are the posts that keep people coming back for more and boost your following like mad. My most engaging post across all metrics was this Power Words post.

Power words are a copywriter’s supertool when it comes to giving your copy some needed pazzazz.

So in this good ol’ fashioned word game post, we listed down some common adjectives and offered alternatives that can evoke more emotion and action. We then asked our followers to fill-in-the-blank and find a better word for: Increase.

These types of posts are quick and easy to answer, evoke our human competitive nature, add value and give your audience the opportunity to interact with you in a fun way.

By mixing up the style, format and design of your posts — while following the ABC copywriting rules in your captions — you’ll boost your engagement and following in no time! Plus, you’ll have **a fun, creative and exciting feed that keeps people coming back** again and again and again.

Before I let you go, here is a a quick list of go-to social media tools we use here at the Copy Posse:

**#1 [Canva](https://www.canva.com/q/pro/?v=2&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=REV_CA_EN_CanvaPro_Branded_Tier1_Core_EM&utm_term=canva&utm_content=REV_CA_EN_CanvaPro_Branded_Tier1_Canva_EM&gclsrc=ds)** – I’m obsessed with Canva for it’s user-friendly, totally customizable and super gorgeous templates and design. This platform has been a saviour for my copywriting agency and academy. I use it for absolutely everything — worksheets, branded Statements of Work, social media posts and YouTube thumbnails!

**#2 [Pretty-Caption.com](https://pretty-caption.com/)** – this simple web tool is a game-changer for formatting instagram captions. Whereas the native Instagram app often removes paragraph breaks and turns your caption into one crammed-up long ass wall of text, this tool makes sure your captions look exactly how you want, beautifully spaced and aligned. To use it just paste your caption into this free tool first and before copying it into Instagram.

And last one, **#3 [Later App](https://later.com/?utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Brand-Later-App-Exact)** – Later is great for you to schedule your posts in advance so that you can plan your content timeline, preview your feed before posting and manage all your social media profiles in one handy app.
