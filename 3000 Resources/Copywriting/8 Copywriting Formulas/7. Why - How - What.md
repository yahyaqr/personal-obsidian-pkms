The Golden Circle is an excellent formula that great companies such as Apple use to inspire people and create a movement.

**“People don’t buy what you do; they buy why you do it. And what you do simply proves what you believe” – Simon Sinek**

#### **WHY (Circle 1 – Innermost)** 

The question you need to ask here is:

-   Why does my company exist?
-   Why do the founders or the employees get out of bed every morning?
-   Why should anyone care about this company?

#### **HOW (Circle 2)**

The key here is to have the answer to the following question: How do you do what others do?

This is also known as the USP (Unique Selling Proposition). This is the element that differentiates you from your competitors. Basically, this is the key factor that explains how your company is better than its competitors.

#### **WHAT (Circle 3)**

Key questions here:

-   What does my company do?
-   What does my company sell?
-   What industry is it in?
