Here’s what the FAB stands for:

-   **FEATURES**
-   **ADVANTAGES**
-   **BENEFITS**

This formula is probably one of the most powerful copywriting formulas. Why? Because it reminds us to always focus on our customers (not that we wouldn’t do it otherwise). The truth is that your customers aren’t so interested in features, and they don’t even care that much about the advantages either. What they really care about is what you offer to them, and how they can benefit from what you offer.

So, to create real interest and desire for your product you need to highlight the benefits you offer to your audience. So, with this copywriting formula, you can actually **focus on** **benefits, not features.** You can use it like this: You get this… _(describe what the customer will get),_ and the product does this… _(describe the advantages of the product)_ …so that you get this… _(describe the benefits customers will get)._
