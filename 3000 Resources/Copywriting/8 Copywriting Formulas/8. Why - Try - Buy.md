Well, according to Momoko Price there might be. And that one copywriting formula to rule them all, could be the **‘Why/Try/Buy’** formula.

According to Momoko Price: “_…virtually every single sales page copywriting formula out there (and there are dozens) essentially follows a basic Why-Try-Buy progression.”_

And what she writes next in her blog is brilliant: _“Go ahead, take a look at some of the most popular sales copywriting formulas out there:_ _[AIDA, AIDCA, PAS, 4Ps, 6+1, PAPA, you name it.](https://copyhackers.com/2015/10/copywriting-formula/)_

They ALL start by first focusing on **WHY** you should care about their product (i.e. by highlighting your key problems and desires).

… Then they transition into giving you a vivid sense of **TRYING** their product (i.e. by describing and demonstrating its unique advantages).

… Then they end off by prompting you to **BUY** (or commit) in some fashion, usually through a prominent call-to-action, bolstered by incentives and anxiety-reducing guarantees.”

So, maybe it’s not a bad idea to keep the **‘Why/Try/Buy’** formula in your _“back pocket as a priceless sanity-check for all the sales copy”_ you write.

In conclusion, copywriting formulas give you a starting point, a framework if you will, that you can actually make your own. That’s what is so great about copywriting. Don’t you think?
