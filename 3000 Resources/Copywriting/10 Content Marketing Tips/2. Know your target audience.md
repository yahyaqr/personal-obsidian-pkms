Identify your audience to make it easier to reach them.  When you define who your audience is, you can determine which channels they’re using. This also helps you identify what they need. And that’s when you craft content tailored to appeal to their interests – smart.

### **How to do it**

To define your target market, start by building buyer personas representing the main segments of your audience. Buyer personas categorize audience segments by demographics, communication preferences, buying goals, and needs. You can download a [buyer persona](https://www.similarweb.com/corp/blog/marketing/content-marketing/buyer-persona/) template to help you set up your own personas. 

Fill out your template categories with information based on [market research](https://www.similarweb.com/corp/blog/research/market-research/what-is-market-research/) into your own customers, your industry, and [competitor analysis](https://www.similarweb.com/corp/marketing/competitive-analysis/). You can also find [influencers](https://www.similarweb.com/corp/blog/marketing/content-marketing/ten-tips-to-create-a-profitable-influencer-marketing-campaign/) who can promote your content on specific platforms your audience uses.

### **Example**

Imagine you’re an eCommerce retailer seeking to develop content for your audience. You might use Similarweb’s behavioral analysis and [audience insights tools](https://www.similarweb.com/corp/research/audience-analysis/) to analyze where your website visitors spend time online, where they’re located, their demographic characteristics, and what their interests are.
