Data makes your content more persuasive, and a great way to display data is to use infographics. This makes your data easy to digest, _and_ as easy to share on social media.

### **How to do it**

First, decide the purpose of your content and what type of data you want to display, then you need to collect the necessary data. Following this, select a suitable format for displaying your data that will provide your audience actionable, interesting, user friendly insights. Some of my favorites include a statistical list, bar charts, or pie charts. 

### **Example**

Our state of [content marketing infographic](https://www.similarweb.com/corp/blog/marketing/content-marketing/infographic-the-state-of-content-marketing-in-2015/) uses bar charts, customized circular pie charts, and other graphics to visually summarize key data.
