Web developers strive to make websites user-friendly so that visitors enjoy browsing and are more likely to convert. The same principle applies to prioritizing reader experience in content marketing. To achieve the desired effect, your content should elicit the intended emotional and cognitive response, and lead to a follow-up action from the reader.

### **How to do it**

Shaping reader experience depends both on your content itself as well as its design. Use your market research to make sure you’re addressing topics and keywords which connect with your audience’s interests. **Present information which addresses their needs and offers solutions.** Include a call to action to elicit the desired follow-up response. On the design side, prioritize readability by using elements such as headings and lists to make content easier to digest.

### **Example**

A great format for prioritizing reader experience is a [how-to article](https://www.similarweb.com/corp/blog/marketing/content-marketing/how-to-writing-guide/). A how-to format lets you tell your reader directly in your title what your content is about. This makes it relevant to readers and friendly to search engines. 

You can structure a how-to article in the form of a list or series of step-by-step instructions, making it easy to read. Note, that this works equally well as a [video marketing strategy](https://www.similarweb.com/corp/blog/marketing/content-marketing/video-marketing-strategy/) as well as for written content.
