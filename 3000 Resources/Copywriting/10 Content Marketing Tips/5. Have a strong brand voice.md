Your [brand voice](https://www.similarweb.com/corp/blog/research/audience-and-brand-building/brand-tone-of-voice/) is the personality and values expressed through your content. A strong brand voice creates a distinct persona that shapes the way your audience perceives your company. It helps position you as an authority and builds trust with your audience.

### **How to do it**

Start by reviewing your current brand voice. This should include a review of your company’s mission statement and values. Create a chart that lists the most important characteristics of your voice. For example, are you helpful, knowledgeable, or practical? 

List some keywords summarizing the characteristics of your voice, describe what each one means, and create some do’s and don’ts for your content creators to follow. After reviewing your current brand voice, decide whether anything needs to be changed, and update your chart accordingly.

### **Example**

Office messaging provider [Slack](https://slack.com/) uses a friendly, helpful brand voice. Slack provides constant assistance to users, conveyed through everything from in-app communications to blog posts. Slack’s tone strikes a balance between professionalism and fun.
