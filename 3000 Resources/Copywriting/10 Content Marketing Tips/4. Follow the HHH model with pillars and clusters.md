“HHH” stands for the “hero, hub, hygiene” model of content marketing, a [content creation process](https://www.similarweb.com/corp/blog/marketing/content-marketing/content-creation-process/) originally developed by Google as a video marketing strategy for YouTubeand later adapted for other promotional channels. This model divides content into three categories:

-   **Hygiene content**: [evergreen content](https://www.similarweb.com/corp/blog/marketing/content-marketing/evergreen-content/) that pulls new readers in with keywords and topics addressing popular interests, typically through formats such as how-to guides and FAQ lists
-   **Hub content**: content, which tends to be more focused on outbound channels. Hub content is to primarily showcase your authority in a topic and engage your audience.
-   **Hero content**: exceptional content intended to raise your brand awareness with mass audiences

With the HHH strategy, the majority of your content falls into the hygiene category, with hub content comprising the next largest segment of your content, and hero content making up the smallest segment. Within this model, content can be organized into [pillar page](https://www.similarweb.com/corp/blog/marketing/content-marketing/pillar-page/) guides each with its own [topic clusters](https://www.similarweb.com/corp/blog/marketing/content-marketing/topic-clusters/) that consist of content related to an overarching theme. This strategy lets you create [Google-friendly content](https://www.similarweb.com/corp/blog/marketing/content-marketing/create-google-friendly-content/) designed to appeal to all segments of your target market in all stages of your marketing funnel.

### **How to do it**

To apply the HHH strategy, create a content calendar for each of the three major categories. Start by creating hygiene content, the workhorse of the HHH strategy. Expand into hub content to develop some topic clusters of interest to your social followers and email subscribers. Develop some hero content geared toward mass audiences, such as seasonal holiday content.

### **Example**

We’ve put together a number of [pillar page examples](https://www.similarweb.com/corp/blog/marketing/content-marketing/pillar-page-examples/) that illustrate the HHH strategy in action. For example, one of our own pillar pages explains [how to build a content marketing strategy](https://www.similarweb.com/corp/blog/marketing/content-marketing/content-marketing-strategy/). It provides a clear list of guidelines. It uses a readable format that is easy to navigate, and includes keywords and internal links to promote [SEO](https://www.similarweb.com/corp/blog/marketing/seo/).

Within the content marketing area of our blog, we show how to write an [SEO-friendly article](https://www.similarweb.com/corp/blog/marketing/content-marketing/seo-friendly-article/). This piece illustrates how to flesh out a topic cluster.
