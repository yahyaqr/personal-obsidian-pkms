It is useless to produce more of the same. If your website or blog delivers only the same basic content that is easily found at other addresses in the segment in which you operate, it will never attract the attention of your persona.

To stand out and gain the trust of your reader, one of the essential elements of copywriting is exclusivity.

Be creative, invest in research and **ensure that your content is unique, with new and relevant information** for your persona.
