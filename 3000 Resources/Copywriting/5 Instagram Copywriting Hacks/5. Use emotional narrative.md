To succeed with Instagram marketing today, you need to focus on users' needs rather than your product. They come online for conflicts and emotions, and they want to read stories that would align with their core values. With that in mind, you need to create content that would appeal to those values but reflect your brand's nature at the same time.

For that, **use emotional narrative in Instagram content.**

It's a writing technique of building your message by particular words, writing structures, and visual hooks to keep users emotionally invested and willing to respond.

That's how to use it:

**1) Appeal to** [**basic instincts**](https://marketinginsidergroup.com/content-marketing/basic-instinct-makes-people-eat-content/)**.** _(They are subconscious needs appearing in our limbic system and are responsible for our behavior, emotions, and motivation.)_ Turning to these instincts in Instagram copywriting, you'll hook readers to respond.

Basic instincts are three: social, self-preservation, and sexual. 

-   Self-preservation is about physical health, safety, and a secure environment. (It makes food and lifestyle blogs so popular.)
-   Social is about creativity and action, personal value, status, and approval.
-   Sexual is about connections, adrenaline, people, attraction.

Use "tasty" words, create the illusion of presence (post quizzes, carousels, tests, and other interactive content), and help users find answers (post strategies, tips, secrets, tools, etc.).

Also, appeal to the "you can do it" mantra in your content. Most users are looking for _easy_ ways to do something, so show them they can do it. Use words such as "easy," "quick," "simple," "DIY," etc.

**2) Use** [**neuro copywriting tactics**](https://www.jeffbullas.com/copywriting-hacks/) **in your posts.** _(It's about the psychological effect of particular words and sounds to the human brain.)_ When written in a definite order and the right place, they serve like mental hooks for the audience.

What tactics to use here:

-   Use active verbs and no weak adverbs.
-   Use odd numbers and beneficial adjectives.
-   Remember about sensory words and phonosemantics (already mentioned above).
-   Use transitional words for better readability.
-   Consider stylistic devices such as repetition, metaphor, and contrast.

Also, **remember about emojis**.

They add extra fun and flavor to Instagram captions. When placed at the end of paragraphs, emojis serve as "bookends," breaking up your long stories. At the very least, [emojis](https://www.quintly.com/blog/instagram-emoji-study) can direct users to take action, like clicking the link or jumping to comments.

Make sure emojis are natural to your brand voice and tone and determine a set of emojis to use for keeping things consistent. And **don't go too far:** a mixed bag of emojis in one caption do harm, not good.
