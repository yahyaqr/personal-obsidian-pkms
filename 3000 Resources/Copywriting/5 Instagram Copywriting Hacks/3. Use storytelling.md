The power of storytelling and the overall [narrative](https://bid4papers.com/blog/narrative-essay) has long been known: A human brain retains 70% of information through stories and 95% – through emotions, so the only way to make people want to listen to you is to tell them a story.

And that's probably the #1 reason why [Instagram Stories](https://www.quintly.com/instagram-stories) is the hottest feature of this social network.

When told right, a story is the best way to make followers see the world through your eyes. For business, storytelling is a chance to build a brand identity and make a personal connection with customers. Stories hook attention, help to remember you, and can motivate users to follow and buy from you with time.

**How to write stories in Instagram captions?**

Make sure to include these four components: your story needs a hero, a structure, cohesiveness, and proximity to the real world.

-   A hero: it may be you, your product, or your customer who solves his problems thanks to your brand.
-   A structure: it's a plot with three main elements of a narrative, such as a set-up, narrative arc, and conflict resolution.

Your narrative arc should be cohesive and relate to the real world. Use the combination of process description, your experience, and feelings for readers to recognize themselves in your story and want to share it.

Remember about **tags and hashtags**. They make your content more visible and help you reach a broader audience. [One to three hashtags](https://www.quintly.com/blog/instagram-study-2019) are most used in Instagram posts, but you are welcome to add more but "hide" them below your story.

It makes your story look more authentic, and it doesn't deflect attention from the content itself. More than that, hidden hashtags and spaces in Instagram captions make your content look more appealing and easy to read.
