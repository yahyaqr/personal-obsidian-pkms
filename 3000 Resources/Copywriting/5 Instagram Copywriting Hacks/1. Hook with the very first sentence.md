As you know, Instagram shortens captions after three lines, so you need to focus on the very first sentence:

Lead with the hook that will be intriguing enough for users to realize they want to keep on reading. Words you use in captions shape your brand's story and personality, so stick to your brand voice and tone.

The most common trick to hook readers is a question. Asking something that triggers a user's need or pain point, you engage them to click "More" in search of the answer.

And yet, there are some **alternative writing hooks you can try besides a question**:

1.  Share a quote. A relevant quote from a celeb your audience loves may influence the engagement rate by far.
2.  Surprise with a misconception. Start with a statement about a universal truth being false. That will intrigue followers to keep on reading.
3.  Write a joke. A little humor helps to grab attention and spark interest in the topic.
4.  Start telling a story. A compelling first sentence makes users click to find out what happened next and what was the end.
5.  Use statistical data. Surprise with a new fact your followers might not have been known, to arouse curiosity.

Sure enough, bare facts and boring statistics don't work on Instagram. So it would be best if you hooked followers with words as well. For that, consider **sensory words**.

These are lexical items that can help readers verbally see, hear, taste, smell, or feel your message. Depending on your brand message, you can choose sensory words that would influence your target audience most.
