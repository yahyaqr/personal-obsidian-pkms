You know the pillar of effective [Instagram content](https://www.quintly.com/blog/social-media-tactics-strategies): engaging and original, it also needs to answer the _"What's in it for me?"_ question.

So, think like a consumer. What value would they get from your writing? What problem or pain point does your product cover and solve? To write an engaging Instagram caption, make sure to highlight and answer these questions.

The problem is that users don't trust brands and their ads anymore. For them to listen to your message, **focus on emotions you want it to trigger**. Your call to action matters, but you need to build a bridge to it in your caption.

Consider a PPB method of Instagram writing. First described by Brian Dean as a copywriting trick to use in blog posts introductions, it fits social media writing too because it motivates followers to click.

-   P — preview: tell users what they'll get from you.
-   P — promise: tell how it will solve their problem.
-   B —  bridge: use a transitional phrase to build a logical bridge to your CTA.

That's what a PPB method looks in marketing blog posts:

Try something like that when writing your Instagram content:

Another trick to consider for better engagement on Instagram: offer tips and tricks to your readers; share educating content with them; provide them with step-by-step instructions. The added value within Instagram captions makes them more likely to be shared or even bookmarked.
