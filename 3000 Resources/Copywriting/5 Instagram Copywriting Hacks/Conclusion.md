On Instagram, users want to see your authenticity and know what happens in your world right now that could relate to them. So, if you want to engage them — give it to them.

-   Hook with the very first sentence: use a question, a quote, a misconception, a joke, or an interesting fact that might surprise the audience.
-   Add value to your every Instagram caption: answer the "What's in it for me?" question.
-   Tell stories: it's your chance to build a brand identity and make a personal connection with customers.
-   Use language tricks: active voice, sensory words, short sentences, emojis, and phonosemantics.
-   Consider emotional narrative: appeal to instincts, use neuro copywriting tricks whenever appropriate, share interactive content, use carousels, and more.

Now, get writing! And remember:

To make sense of your Instagram marketing, you need to know what's working and what isn't to increase your engagement rates. So, always [measure your Instagram efforts](https://www.quintly.com/instagram-analytics): track the data to see how users interact with your Instagram content and optimize the strategy based on your Instagram analytics.
