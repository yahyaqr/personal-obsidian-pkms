When thinking of a [working plan](https://monday.com/s/work-plan-creation) and content strategy for Instagram, make sure to incorporate the sense of authenticity into it. The top Instagram trend in 2020, it plays a significant role in engaging the audience.

Particular gimmicks with language can help you sound more authentic.

First and foremost, remember that only [29%](https://digitalducats.com/seo-statistics/#social) of Instagram users are over 35. The majority are Millennials and Gen Z representatives who communicate and perceive information faster and simpler. A content shock and short attention span make them ignore long, annoying texts with tons of professional slang and [marketing buzzwords](https://www.quintly.com/blog/social-media-buzzwords).

So, it would help if you focused on writing conversational captions. **Write like a human, not a robot:** use active voice, short sentences, emojis (where appropriate), and spaces for better readability. Sure enough, you want to be strategic and intentional; but also be natural for users to feel like you are their friend.

**How to be authentic on Instagram:**

-   Share real, behind-the-scenes content.
-   Incorporate memes and tweets (another content trend on Instagram in 2020, by the way) for a relatable feel.
-   Use diverse models in photos; make everything look natural in pics.
-   Consider interactive content whenever you can.
-   Write the way you speak; stick to words everybody knows.
-   Consider your brand voice and tone: you want to sound young but not childish; confident but not cocky; funny but not clownish.

This caption is about /b/ to tell about something big and loud to emphasize confidence and create a sense of urgency.
