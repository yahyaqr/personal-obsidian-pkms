If you want your headline to be in the form of a question, you’ll need to create a question that would interest your audience. And would want to read the answer to that question.

In case the question in your headline doesn’t attract curiosity, your audience will lose interest.

Try asking a benefit-related question. Tying your headline question to your brand’s primary benefit will surely raise curiosity. This way you can win your audience over to your side, by simply replying to questions they need answers for.
