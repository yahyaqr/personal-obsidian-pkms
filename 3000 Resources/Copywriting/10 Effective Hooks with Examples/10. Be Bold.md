One surefire way to get more eyes on your copy is to say something completely unexpected or controversial. Even if controversy is seen as a negative, it definitely sparks conversation. Turns out the phrase “no such thing as bad press” holds true.

That doesn’t mean you should take the most extreme positions or make actively harmful statements. Doing so reflects poorly on you and on your client, which could lead to negative consequences for a long period of time after. Even if you do see an initial boost in traffic and purchases from it, the long-term ramifications aren’t worth it.

Strive to be bold without being harmful. Consider this radical example:

“Move out of the way, pineapple! Kiwi has taken your spot as the best fruit to put on pizza.”
