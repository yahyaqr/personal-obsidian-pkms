[Humans are emotional buyers](https://procopytips.com/hidden-motivators/), even if we like to think otherwise. What better way to “bait” out emotion than with a great “hook”?

A lot of charities and animal rights organizations employ this tactic in their marketing. Those commercials of abused animals overlayed with Sarah McLachlan music are often so sad they’re difficult to watch (at least for me). Yet, they obviously inspire people to donate by creating such a strong emotional response.

It’s important to think about the kind of emotion you want the reader to feel. If you’re selling bounce houses, you don’t want to showcase animal abuse.

Instead, you’ll want something like this:

“Summer is here, along with the kids! Give yourself a break and get them out of the house with an easy-to-store bounce house!”
