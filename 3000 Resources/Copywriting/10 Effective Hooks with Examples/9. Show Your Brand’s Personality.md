The expectations of brands have changed a lot in the past few years. The quality of a product or service used to be what mattered most, but nowadays the personality of a brand is often a bigger selling point than what they make.

You can use this to your advantage when writing your hook. Research the personality and tone of your client’s brand and use it to attract customers. This could mean telling a joke, complaining about a relevant issue, self-aware commentary, etc.

This hook is the best one for showcasing your creativity as a writer. As long as you follow the established tone and voice of the brand, feel free to try something new or interesting.

Jeep is a great example. They have established themselves as [the rugged, off-road car company](https://twitter.com/Jeep/status/1398263142963089412) and uses that personality in their marketing.
