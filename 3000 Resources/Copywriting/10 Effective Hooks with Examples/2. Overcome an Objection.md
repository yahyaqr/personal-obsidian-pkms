If there are obvious issues or objections potential customers could have with the product or service you are trying to sell, ignoring them is the worst thing you can do. Instead, you can turn those problems into a compelling hook that relieves their fears.

Maybe you’re selling a luxury vehicle to people who wouldn’t easily be able to pay for it? If the price is an obvious objection, then highlight the affordable payment plan. 

An **example** of this could look like this:

“An affordable payment plan makes it easy for anyone to obtain this new high-end luxury vehicle.”
