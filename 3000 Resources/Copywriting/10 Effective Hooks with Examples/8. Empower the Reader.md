So much of modern marketing is oriented towards ease-of-use and minimal impact on customer life. However, sometimes you want a potential customer to feel like their purchase makes an active change in the world.

Empowering the reader gives them a sense of purpose they likely don’t get anywhere else. Charities use this method the most, but there are some companies that implement it effectively as well, like [BoxLunch](https://www.boxlunch.com/homepage?cjevent=34b3ca36c3f711eb815377e00a1c0e0e&cm_mmc=AFF-_-CJN-_-Skimlinks-_-100025254-_-14038865). Look for and highlight any beneficial social or environmental impacts your client’s product or service provides.

[Charity: water](https://www.charitywater.org/) is an organization that employs this hook effectively.
