Different people have different styles of practicing and you should do what works best for you. The various possible approaches are:

1.  **Breadth-first preparation** - Revise every topic and then start practicing a variety of questions across all topics. This strategy is recommended if you have around a month to spare.
2.  **Depth-first preparation** - Tackle one topic at a time - revise materials for a topic, practice lots of questions for that topic. After ensuring mastery of a topic, move on to the next topic. Repeat for all or selected topics. If you don't have much time, this might be the best way to prepare. You can focus on the High priority topics in our recommended study plan.
3.  **Depth-first-then-breadth preparation** - Tackle one topic at a time - revise materials for a topic, practice a few questions for that topic. After ensuring mastery, move on to the next topic. Repeat for all topics. At the end, practice a variety of questions across all topics. This strategy takes more time than others, so it's recommended if you have more than a month.

My personal recommendation would be the **Breadth-first preparation** or **Depth-first-then-breadth preparation**. It's important to have some form of breadth-level studying / practicing in your schedule so that you don't forget about the earlier topics as you move on to later topics.
