Choice Awareness
---
>In essence, you make your choices, and then your choices make you. Every decision, no matter how slight, alters the trajectory of your life.

> The first step toward change is awareness. If you want to get from where you are to where you want to be, you have to start by becoming aware of the choices that lead you away from your desired destination.

>The choices that lead to life-altering change are, on the surface, disarmingly small. The good ones are easy to overlook and the bad ones are easy to forgive. What’s more, cause and effect are so distant that they’re hard to connect.

>At the end of the day, look at the list and ask yourself: Are these choices consistent with my core values? Are they in alignment with who I want to become?

>Cross out any choice that didn’t move you closer to where you ultimately want to be. Over time, you’ll gain awareness of your moment-to-moment choices and consistently make choices that move you towards your ultimate goal.

Why Power
---
> Most of use wouldn't walk a plank between two high rise buildings for $20 dollars. But Darren says: "If your child was on the opposite building, and that building was on fire, would you walk the length of the plank to save him? Without question and immediately—you’d do it, twenty dollars or not."

>Your ‘WHY Power’ is the internal drive you need to get started and take massive action. Your WHY can take two forms: what you love and what you hate. Your why doesn't have to be noble, it just has to move you.

Bookend Routines
---
> The key to becoming world-class in your endeavors is to build your performance around world-class routines.

> It can be difficult, even futile, to predict or control what will show up in the middle of your workday. But you can almost always control how your day starts and ends. You need to have routines for both.

>**Morning Routine:** Review your vision/mission, set the top priority for the day, read something positive and instructional, and do work to advance your most important project.

>**Nighttime Routine:** Reflect on the choices you’ve made throughout the day, be grateful for the wins you experienced, and get curious about how you can improve tomorrow by asking yourself: How could I have made today even better?

New Life Goal, New Daily Habit
---
> The moment you come up with a new life goal, instantly turn it into a tiny, daily habit you can practice.

>For example, if you want to eat healthy, switch your after-lunch-Snickers for an apple. If you want to become a writer, start writing 250 words a day. And if you finally want to meet someone to fall in love with, send a message to one person every day.

Create Routine, Build Up Momentum
---
>The more good habits you accumulate, the more good decisions you’ll make, until it becomes really easy to choose what’s right. Chances are, you’ll feel unstoppable at some point, because you’ve got the Big Mo (big momentum) on your side.

>Because of the way momentum works, the hardest part is to get it going in the first place. That’s why initially, you should focus on creating a routine you can consistently show up for – even if you’re not making it all the way through.

>Keep showing up until your habit clicks into a routine.
