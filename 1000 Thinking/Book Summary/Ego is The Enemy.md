Forever a Student

>It is impossible for a man to learn that, which he thinks he already knows.” 

\- Epictetus

> You aren’t as good as you think you are, you probably need your attitude readjusted, and the things you learned in books or school are out of date or wrong.

Live with Purpose Not Passion (Euthymia)
---
> Why do I do what I do? Who am I? What purpose am I serving?

> The critical work that you want to do will require your deliberation and consideration. Leave passion for the amateurs. Make it about what you feel you must do and say, not what you care about and wish to be.

>  The Greeks used the word [_Euthymia_](https://dailystoic.com/trust-yourself/) for this which is a sense of our own path and how we can stay on it without getting distracted. Prioritize your goals with clarity and then follow through.

> Bill Walsh, 49ers Coach, did not focus on some vague notion of “winning.” He knew that focusing on the basics and perfecting those would lead to success. He could change what the team was doing and how effectively they were working, but he could not put on a definitive timeline when the next win would happen. He was attached to effort (the part that could be controlled) not outcomes (which were out of his control).

> Alive time is time when you are actively using your time usefully and improving; dead time is time you spend passive.

> It’s about being what you are, and being as good as possible at it, without succumbing to all the things that draw you away from it.
> \--- Ryan Holiday, page 117

Do your Best, Forget the Rest
---
> We have only minimal control over the rewards for our work and effort–other people’s validation, recognition, rewards. So what are we going to do? Not be kind, not work hard, not produce, because there is a chance it wouldn’t be reciprocated? C’mon.
> \--- Ryan Holiday, page 178

Always Love
---
> Hate at any point is a cancer that gnaws away at the very vital center of your life and your existence. It is like eroding acid that eats away the best and the objective center of your life,
